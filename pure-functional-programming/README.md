## Functional Programming in Golang


Why functional programming helps us be more productive than the imprative alternative?

All computer hardware is designed to execute machine code, which is native to the computer, written in the
iperative style. The program state is defined by the contents of memory, and the statements are instructions in the machine
language where each statement advances the state of computation forward, toward a final outcome.
Iperative programas change their state over time, step by step. High-level imperative languages, such as C and Go, use variables and more
complex statements, but they still follow the same paradigm. Since the basic ideas in imperative programming are
both conceptually similar to low-level code that operates directly on computer hardware, most computer languages such as Go, also known
as C are largely imperative.


Imparative progarmming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.

Declarative programming we declare what we want the results to be. We describe what we want, not detailed instructions of how to get it.
